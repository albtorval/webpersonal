<p>Our article <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417425013272"><strong>“A fresh view on Least Quantile of Squares Regression based on new optimization approaches”</strong></a>, coauthored by Justo Puerto and Alberto Torrejón, has just been published in <em>Expert Systems With Applications</em>.</p>
<p>But… what is this paper really about?</p>

<p>You’re probably familiar with the image of a scatter plot and a line running through it, right?<br />
Exactly! This work revisits the well-known <strong>linear regression</strong> model.
And while it might seem like everything has already been said about it… that’s not quite true.
The estimator most people know is <strong>Least Squares (LS)</strong> — it’s simple, easy to compute, and widely used. But it’s not flawless.</p>
<p><img src="/post/Img/ART3_3.jpg" style="width:75.0%;height:75.0%" /></p>
<p>That’s why researchers have proposed alternatives: either by making LS more robust or by designing new estimators with better statistical properties or fewer theoretical assumptions. (Some examples are in the images below.)</p>

<p>In fact, you can generalize many of these estimators by means of an ordered approach known as Ordered Linear Regression:</p>

<p>One of the most powerful alternatives is called <strong>Least Quantile of Squares (LQS)</strong>.<br />
But here’s the catch: the more statistically precise the estimator, the harder it becomes to compute.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>That’s where we come in</strong></p>
<p>In our paper, we expand the range of models capable of solving the LQS regression <strong>optimally</strong>. We introduce three mathematical programming formulations based on sorting techniques, and a fourth model based on <strong>bilevel optimization</strong>.</p>

<p>🎯 <em>Spoiler alert from our next paper:</em><br />
Did you know that simply sorting residuals can help generalize many families of estimators? These are known as <strong>L-estimators</strong>, and they’re incredibly useful. But — and here’s the challenge — <strong>sorting optimally is no easy task</strong>.</p>
